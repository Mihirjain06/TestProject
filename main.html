        <h1 class="title">Happy Birthday Vendi! 🎂✨</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">May this year bring you full of happiness and everything your heart has ever wished for.
            🥳✨<br>
            Our bond is the permanent, never-coming-off kind — and I really hope it stays exactly like this forever.
            ❤️🫂<br>
            Everyone gives you gifts, but I wanted to do something different this time with this chotu si website😜.
            Hope you like it…<br>
            I was genuinely so excited for your birthday because it’s the birthday of the person who brought real
            laughter back into my life. 😭🙌<br>
            Thank you, Vendi — seriously.<br>
            <b>You’ve been my best buddy since forever!🫶</b><br>
            Yeah yeah, I know — according to you, “forever” doesn’t even exist 😂<br>
            But listen: no matter what you say, no matter how many gaalis you throw at me, I’m sticking by your side.
            Always. 😤<br>
            <b class="mt-2"><i>Happy Birthday again!</i></b>

                I knew you'd give all the right answers, even with a little help from me. 😊
                You truly understand me, you care for me so much, you even cry for me sometimes, and you do so many
                things for me…<br>
                If you do all this, then on your birthday, the least I can do is something for you.<br> It’s not super
                special, but I put in a lot of effort to make this — just because I like you a lot. ❤️
                All the bakchodi we do together, creating those funny-funny moments, clicking photos, making weird and
                wonderful memories… all of it will stay with us forever. 📸😂
                Thank you for giving me all of this.<br>
